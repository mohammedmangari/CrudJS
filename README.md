### javaScript code

- JavaScript code that creates an application for managing a product catalog. The code uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to access and manipulate the elements of an HTML page.
The code declares several variables that represent HTML elements on the page, such as input fields for the product name, category, price, and other details, as well as buttons for submitting the data and a table for displaying the products.
The code uses event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicking the submit button to add a new product to the catalog or hovering over an image to change its source.
The code also uses local storage to save the product data in the browser, so that it persists even when the page is reloaded.
The code uses DOM manipulation to add, update and delete items from the catalog.
